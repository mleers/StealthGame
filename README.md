# Stealth Game
This is a stealth game where you need to sneak past ghosts to reach the end of the map to win. <br>
Character assets and sounds are from the Unity asset store, scripts/behaviors and everything else is produced by me.

## Things I learned creating this game: 
* instantiating unit models and prefabs
* creating/assigning animator states and transitions
* assigning physics to game objects
* scripting object interactions
    * character movement in 3D
    * creating enemy behaviors with raycasting and waypoints
    * win/loss screens from trigger interactions
* creating lighting and navmesh
* assigning a virtual camera


## TODO List:
* [x] create win zone (trigger)
* [ ] animate enemies
* [ ] enhance environment textures
* [ ] add additional audio, possibly a soundtrack
* [ ] introduce player-world interactivity
* [ ] add additional rooms/levels, score capabilities?
* [ ] add post processing
